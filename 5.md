Today we discussed "Good Samaritan laws." I understand the thought process behind the law, but find it highly funny that such a law needs to be in place. I can't even imagine the amount of malice it would take to sue someone for trying to stop the loss of a loved one in a horrible accident.

The depths at which humanity sinks for self-gain never ceases to amaze me.
