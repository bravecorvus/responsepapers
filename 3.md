One of the things discussed in todays class was to see if impartiality is an unattainable virtue. I take the strong position that whether or not impartiality is possible, it is irrelevant: we must assume that it is possible and push ahead to try to achieve this.

The reason is this: what if we completely assumed for a moment that we went around assuming impartiality is not possible. The concrete worldviews that are forged from this premise are incredibly poisonous to society. From my experience, all plans that follow this premise generally have the characteristic of trying to right a wrong by "wronging a wrong."

Take the example of affirmative action: I will not make any case on whether or not it is necessary in the current day to at least offset the effects of systematic racism. However, there are those who believe if to be a wholistically good policy that should stay forever. However, I highly disagree with this view. Although we cannot overlook the systematic racism that exists today, to say that we will fix this by prioritizing people based on race alone (over merit), then we are using inequality to fix inequality. In a sense, affirmative action is a policy which takes the assumption that a fair society cannot be achieved and hence we will be satisfied for the moment with lowering the bar for certain people in order to make this fair.

Affirmative action also gives the people in society that do not recognize systematic inequality a reason to make the opposing argument that institutions favor minorities over the majority due to some twisted liberal conspiracy. Instead of focusing on affirmative action, I would instead focus on equalizing grade school education and funding that at all levels.

In other words, I believe policies that result from the assumption that impartiality is impossible only leads to half-measures; picking the lowest hanging fruit just for aesthetic purposes rather than actually tacking the problem head on. Hence, this is why I believe we need to believe impartiality is possible.
