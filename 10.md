Would Our Demise Be Better for the Universe?

On this topic, I would have to say that our demise is largely ineffectual for the universe at large. By universe, we are referring to all matter in existance. Mankind makes up but a molecule of a sand particle, in an entire beach.

Hence, my view has been for myself, my annihilation will have no effect on the universe as a whole. To think that mankind lies in a special place in the universe is to assign ourselves too much credit. Our own annihilation will not pause the expansion of the universe; it will not break the time-space continuum; it will not create a singularity by which all matter will be compressed into, annihilating the universe itself.
Hence, our own failure to comprehend a world without us is only our own pretenses, and lack of self-awareness.
