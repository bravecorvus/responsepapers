Aristotle says happiness is what we all seek out, or to put it in another his terms, "highest good is happiness." Although it seems logical enough, I feel this answer is lazy at best and wrong at worst.

Nietzsche once said "To those human beings who are of any concern to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill-treatment, indignities—I wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not—that one endures."

Nietzsche had suffered much throughout his life. He required financial assistance from his family just to subsist, suffered madness due to contracting syphilis, and dying alone and largely unrecognized for the philosophical big-shot he is currently recognized as. Although his experience could have breeded resentment and nihilism, Nietzsche instead sought to view his afflictions as a positive rather than a negative. Nietzche conjectured that suffering is what made his character strong and vibrant. He believes that those that do not live through any type of cannot forge type of resilient personality that makes them a well-fulfilled human.
