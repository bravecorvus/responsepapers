Does Participating in or Observing a so-called Wrong Doing Reduce the Complicity of an Actor?

I disagree with this notion. Although abstract, I will illustrate this point with two specific thought experiements.

We are all citizens in the United States. Does that mean that we all need to join war in order to understand the gravity of what our government does on a daily basis?
Let's say that every person in America voted for the Vietnam War, yet only the poor actually got drafted. Then this is clearly a gross injustice, especially in the case of those in society engaged in the military industrial complex. Then, no matter how many people join the war, as long as there are people who voted for the war who are not actively risking their lives and backing their vote with their life, then there is no justification for that war to begin with. Hence, the only way one can stay "non-complicit" is to vote for politicians who are anti-war. THe implications of this is that altough we do not need to join the war to avoid complicity, it is incumbent upon us to closely follow the actions of our governments and to ensure that continue to be a "well-educated electorate."
Do we personally have to personally participate in transporting human excrement to fully appreciate the magnitude of modern waste sanitation services?
I argue no. We can all quickly see the implications of lacking modern waste sanitation by taking a camping trip to a place without it. Of course, on a side note, anyone can easily look at a history book to see that all civilization is the result of centralization and work specialization, which is only possible through sanitation. Hence, no one needs to participate directly in waste sanitation to see the implications.
