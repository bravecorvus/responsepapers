Today in class, we pondered the question "Would you steal medicine to save your child?" One key observation I have about this topic is the fact that we all have monsters lurking in ourselves. What makes this question interesting is that there is an "easy way out," which can be sumamrized as "even if I stole the medicine, it would be for my own progeny who would die without it. Hence, theft < murder (crime of omission)." Hence to me, the more interesting question is if we were in Nazi Germany, would we have participated in the mass genocide of Jews?

I believe that we would. There was nothing that distinguished Germans from the humanity at large (other than mass desperation from the policies drafted after WWI to punish Germany). The Nazi's are a convenient group of people to pin the concept of evil on. However, this approach is both limited and incorrect. I believe that we must recognize our own capacity to commit such acts of violence against other members of the human race, and actively fighting against such impulses. Without doing this, we open ourselves to repeat the same mistakes over and over again.
