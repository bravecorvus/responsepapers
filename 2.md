Today, we talked about Alan Turing in context of his conceptualization of the Imitation Game. Although the philosophy of the whether AI can have a soul is intriging, one thing I was always intriged me was the historical context of Turing's life. His work on a machine to decrypt the Nazi's Enigma machine was one of the key things that allowed the Allied powers to win WWII. Despite his service (as well as other contributions to the computer science community), Turing was persecuted for being a homosexual, and was forced to undergo hormonal treatment to lower libido.

The question this made me ponder is whether society has a concept of a hero? Take for example the long list of athletes we once held in high esteem and their fall from the grace. You have Michael Phelps who was ostracised for smoking weed/drunk driving, Lance Armstrong for using performance enhancing drugs, Tiger Woods for sleeping around. All of these crimes were "victimless" in a sense, and the only wrong that could be identified was a "wrong against the traditions and formalities of society."

Was their fall from grace justified? I would argue no. Of course there are instances of crimes with victims, (i.e. high profile athletes beating their husbands and wives). However, outside of these people the only reason they ever persecuted for their crimes was that we put them on a petastal as a examplary human (albeit with some benefits such as sponsorship deals). However, the question stands: what is a hero to society? Are heros just mere humans we endow with an unimpeachable character? Do we just use such individuals until they fuck up, or they outlive their usefulness, then throw them aside?

I always believed the British Empires treatment of Turing was highly unjust. It made me rethink how I think I have the right to stick my nose into celebrity gossip, or assuming any afflictions that befall them as "the higher they go, the higher the fall."
