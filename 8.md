As we enter into the third decade of the second millenium, we as a species are assigning more and more of our means of production to machines. This is primarly accomplished in two capacities: the physical machines that replace manual labor and machine learning which break down complex tasks into much smaller ones. Although many salient philosophical debates exist within the realm of the ramifications of a world where robots have replaced humans as the primary workhorses producing goods and services (e.g. economy, job loss, Terminator-esque distopia), here, I want to explore the ethics of mass data collection.

As a computer scientist, I posses an almost inherant pro-data analytics background. I have taken classes specifically big data science, and have been taught that machine learning is the end-all-be-all solution to free up human labor and create a more efficient society. Through collecting data and analyzing how users interact with the world around them as well as the various inefficiencies they encountered, we can design machines (both physical and virtual) that can fulfill the needs of human beings far more efficiently than was possible before. Through this process, we can free up human labor and apply their labor into applications which require the human element. This utopic view of how large-scale data collection works is almost anti-thetical to the views held by many privacy advocates. 

The Snowden Leaks of 2013 shocked entire populations around the world. We were all stunned at the amount of metadata that the N.S.A. just systematicaly collected on everyone (rather than actively collected based on targeting individuals who acually pose a threat to the Union). After numerous Congressional hearings as well as public outcry, the almost Orwellian distopian reality largely subsided to the back consciousness of our minds. We knew we couldn't fight Big Sam. So, we as individuals, we became ever more careful, ever more distrustful about surveilance.

Arguably the scariest part of this Big Brother nightmare is the fact that we are given no paramters on on what grounds and how much information is being collected about us by the government (And by we, I mean citizens of United States with full protections under the constitution. People living abroad have even less of an idea). So if government establishes a privacy environment devoid of transparency, how does private industry do?

In order to use many of the software and services we use today, we were forced to sign a end-user license agreement which often times, we don't remember signing much less reading. Companies often embed their privacy policies (or lack thereof) in the deep crevices of this document with the expectation that no one will read it. Many online services have clauses (often shown just as a pop-up for the first time user), stating that just by using service, users inherantly agree to the terms and conditions of the service including the those regarding privacy.

Of course all of these issues of privacy being stripped from our day to day life could be chalked up to the cost of more convenient society. However, I argue that this level of opaquness surrounding big data analytics does not benefit neither those who are analyzing the data, nor the users of a particular software or service. Users knowing that they are being watched will no longer act as they would otherwise while using products with limited privacy protections, which skews data and will not benefit the end model. At the same time, users feel disenfranchised that every product they use in their day to day lives fail to protect the information they hold dearly and instead used as a money making scheme. The question then for proponent of big data analytics becomes will large scale data science work to exploit us? or to ehance our lives?

The resulting answer would have massive ramifications on the interactions between users and software. Although up to this point, the conversation has been steered largely by big government and big business, it is imperitive that we as equal stakeholders in this conversation, begin to voice our concerns and to set universal boundaries on what elements of our lives we allowed to be collected and to what extent.
