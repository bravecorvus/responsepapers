On Googleâ€™s Ideological Echo Chamber (An Informal Paper)
Andrew Lee

In September of 2017, news broke of a Google software engineer getting for a paper he published on an internal board. In Google's Ideological Echo Chamber, James Damore argues that Google's policy of inclusion (as a solution for the problem gender discrepency in high tech) has been perpetuated by Google executives without much input from opposing views (much like an echo chamber). Furthermore, he argues that some fundamental differences between women and man might also contribute to said gender discrepency such as basic biology, work life balance requirements, and evolutionary psychology.

Although his view points might have been erroneous and can even considered offensive, I believe that the liberals as well as conservatives needs to provide an open envionment for such discussions to take place. To a large extent, Clinton's loss in 2016 could be attributed to the left's elitist strategy of igoring the alt-right as pariahs of our society, and refusing to engage in a civil discussion and letting arguments based on character traits rather than political views determine the fate of the election.

Indeed, Google's firing of James Damore only reinforces Damore's point that Google's inclusion policy exists in a void of alternative views. Although I do not agree with them, I believe that by engaging in his critics in an open and honest way, Google's inclusion policy could be further strengthened. On a larger scale, by providing a forum for open engagement between left and right, I believe the United States can escape this toxic climate of political polarization that forces us to vote for personalities and cheap insults and rather than political ideals.
