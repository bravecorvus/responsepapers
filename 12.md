On Campbell's interpretation of free will.
Campbell seems to struggle with lecturing about free will, or at least skeptical of others interpretations. Campbell argues that there are desires and objectives that drive free will, so actions are motivated by desires and therefore the actionâ€™s origin resides within those desires.

However, this does not account for so called "higher-virtue" actions, or rather, the type of actions which may harm those that undertake them, yet benefit others. These actions have desire working against them, yet what motivates the action itself? It must then be attributed to that of the spiritual realm.
